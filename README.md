# CS 4395

A temporary repository containing all homework assignments for _CS 4395: Human
Language Technologies_.

## Homework 00: An Overview of NLP

The first homework assignment consists of creating this repository along with a
short list of introductory questions to answer. This has been accomplished via
my favorite general-purpose markup language: (g)roff. While a
[Makefile](./homework00/Makefile) has been included to build the resultant PDF
file, I've also included [the file itself](./homework00/homework00.pdf) for
convenience.

## Homework 01: Text processing with Python

A short little demo assignment that manually reads a CSV file, parses it into
instances of a `Person` class (along with allowing the user to interactively
fix any malformed data), and does a funny little dance of writing and
immediately reading it back from a temporary pickle file before printing the
entries out in a human-readable format.

For more information, check the [README](./homework01/README.md).
