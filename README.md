# CS 4395

A temporary repository containing all homework assignments for _CS 4395: Human
Language Technologies_.

## Homework 00: An Overview of NLP

The first homework assignment consists of creating this repository along with a
short list of introductory questions to answer. This has been accomplished via
my favorite general-purpose markup language: (g)roff. While a
[Makefile](./homework00/Makefile) has been included to build the resultant PDF
file, I've also included [the file itself](./homework00/homework00.pdf) for
convenience.
